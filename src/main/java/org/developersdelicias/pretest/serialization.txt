Which of the following two statements is true regarding object serialization in Java?

a) A serializable interface declares two methods, readObject() and writeObject(). To support serialization in your class,
you need to implement the Serializable interface and define these two methods.

b) When serializing an object that has references to other objects, the serialization mechanism also includes the
referenced objects as part of the serialized bytes.

c) When an object is serialized, the class members that are declared as transient will not be serialized (and hence their
values are lost after deserialization).

d) The Externalizable interface is a marker interface; in other words, it's an empty interface that does not declare any
methods.

e) If you attempt to serialize or persist an object that does not implement the Externalizable interface, you'll get a
NotExternalizableException.


My answers:

c) and d)
